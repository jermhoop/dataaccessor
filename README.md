dataaccessor
============

Data Accessor is a C# class that makes connecting to multiple databases easy (like SQL Server and MySQL).

I've got code in here that will allow one to create generic connections and data readers without having to say SqlConnection or MySqlConnection.

The advantage of this is that if databases change, your code is easy to update in one line of code here.
